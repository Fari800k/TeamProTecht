# TeamProTecht
Project Title: TeamProTectht - An Online Mobile Store

Project Description:
The overall aim of the project is to design and deploy an e-commerce platform to sell mobile phones 
and accessories, of which the UI (user interface) would be intuitive and easy to interact with. As well 
as this, the platform would have to handle customersâ€™ data whilst also manage the inventory levels of 
the different mobile devices and the accessories using a collaboration of databases. Although the 
preferred method of development would be using the Laravel framework, most of the members of 
the team are more proficient using HTML, CSS and JavaScript meaning that it would be a more suited 
approach to use this tech stack to reduce the time of development.

The team have identified the business domain would mobile/telecommunications and have also 
derived that target audience would be between the ages of 16-24 year olds because 95% of them 
own a phone (ONS, 2015). We believe targeting such audience would help to support the rapid 
growth of the business as shown from the project brief, whilst also making it easier to design around 
as all team members fall under this age bracket. Within the appendix section, you can find the user 
story mapping which looks at the scope of the project, identifying key deliverables.
